The One With the Sonogram at the End (S01E02)

[Scene: Central Perk. Everyone's there.]

Monica: What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.

Joey: Yeah, right. You serious?

Phoebe: Oh, yeah.

Rachel: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.

Monica: Absolutely.

Chandler: Yeah. I think, for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, you know. I mean, it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.

Ross: Yeah. And-and it's not that we don't like the comedian. It's just that's…that's not why we bought the ticket.

Chandler: See, the problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, you know. I mean, we're in the car. We're fighting traffic. Basically just trying to stay awake.

Rachel: Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home and listening to that album alone.

Joey: [to Ross] Are we still talking about sex?

[Scene: Museum of *Prehistoric* History. Ross and a co-worker are setting up an exhibit which includes some *mannequins* of cave people.]

Ross: No, it's good. It is good. It's just that, mmm…Doesn't she seem a little angry?

Marsha: Well, she has issues.

Ross: Does she?

Marsha: You think it's easy trying to live with Mr. Hey I Am Evolving? He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the *mastodon* smell out of the carpet.

Ross: Okay. Marsha, see, these are, are cave people, okay? They have issues like, 'Gee, that *glacier*'s getting kinda close.' See?

Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife?

[Ross' ex-wife Carol is standing outstide the exhibit.]

Ross: [trying to ignore her] My-No. No.

Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol. Hi!

Ross: Okay. Yes. Yes, it is. [waves] How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age.

Marsha: Can I stay?

Ross: That would be no.

[Marsha exits. Ross waves Carol into the exhibit.]

Ross: Hi. [hugs Carol while holding one of the cavemen's mannequins arms]

Carol: Hi. Oh. Is this a bad time?

Ross: No. No. It's-it's…the Stone Age. You look great. I, uh…I hate that.

Carol: Sorry. Thanks. You look good too.

Ross: Ah, well, you know, in here, anyone who…stands erect. So what's new? Still, uh…

Carol: A lesbian? [She nods.]

Ross: Well, you never know. How's, um...How's the family?

Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and uh-

Ross: Why, why are you here, Carol?

Carol: I'm pregnant.

Ross: Pregnant?!

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's. Chandler, Joey and Phoebe are watching TV. Monica is busy cleaning the apartment.]

Chrissy on Three's Company: [holding a bra] Ha! Looks like she didn't leave in such a hurry after all.

Chandler: Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company with some kind of misunderstanding.

Phoebe: Then I've already seen this one. [turns off the TV]

Monica: [taking a drink from Joey] Are you through with that?

Joey: Yeah. Sorry. The swallowing slowed me down.

Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?

Chandler: Oh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself. And then I realized I didn't need the note. So I balled it up and…[sees Monica glaring at him] Now I wish I was dead.

[Monica starts to *fluff* a pillow]

Phoebe: She's already fluffed that pillow. Monica, you know, you've already fluffed- [Monica gives her a glare.] But it's fine.

Monica: Look, I'm sorry, guys. I just don't wanna give them any more *ammunition* than they already have.

Chandler: Yes. And we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.

Joey: Would you relax? You do this every time they come. The place looks great. You got a beautiful *lasagna* here that looks good enough to…[He is gonna touch it. Monica slaps him on his hand.] avoid touching.

Phoebe: Monica. Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're like all *chaotic* and *twirly*, you know. Not-not in a good way.

Joey: Yeah. Calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and…twirly every time they come.

Monica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. You see, he's 'the prince'. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.

Chandler: [looking out the window] Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew!

Monica: What?

Chandler: Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!

All: Ewww!

[Rachel enters from her bedroom.]

Rachel: Has anybody seen my engagement ring?

Phoebe: Yeah, it's beautiful.

Rachel: Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. [starts to look under the couch cushions]

Phoebe: No, don't touch that.

Rachel: Oh. Like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him. 'Hi, Barry. Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family.' Oh God. And now I'm gonna have to return the ring. Without the ring, which makes it so much harder.

Monica: Easy, Rachel. We'll find it. [to all] Won't we?

Chandler and Joey: Oh. Yeah.

Monica: Okay. Look, it's gonna be okay. You'll give it back to him. And it will all be over. And we'll eat a lot of ice cream.

Rachel: Okay. Okay. It's-it's a little pear-shaped diamond-

Monica: [interrupts] I'll tell you what, any diamond ring we find, we'll run it by you.

Joey: Alright, when did you have it on last?

Phoebe: Doy! Probably right before she lost it.

Chandler: You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days.

Rachel: I know I had it this morning. I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with…

Chandler: Dinah?

Rachel: [looks at the lasagna and realizes something] Oh, don't be mad.

Monica: You didn't.

Rachel: Oh, I'm sorry.

Monica: I gave you one job! [starts to examine the lasagna through the bottom of the glass pan]

Rachel: Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!

Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagna.

Monica: [puts down the lasagna] I just can't do it.

Chandler: Boys? We're going in.

[Chandler, Joey and Phoebe start to pick through the lasagna. There's a knock on the door. Monica answers it.]

Ross: [standing outside the door] Hi.

Monica: That is not a happy 'hi'.

Ross: Carol's pregnant.

Phoebe: [while everyone else is stunned] Ooh! I found it!

Monica: Wha-, wha-, wha-, wha-?

Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now.

Chandler: That puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh? Mon?

Rachel: Well, now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?

Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved. But if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved. Basically, it's totally up to me.

Phoebe: She is so great. I miss her.

Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'?

Chandler: I mean, presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.

Joey: And the most enjoyable. [He laughs. Ross and Monica stare at him.] Phoebe, say something.

Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this…sonogram thing with them tomorrow.

Monica: Wow.

Ross: Yeah. Remember back when life was simpler, and she was just a lesbian.

Chandler: God, those were the days.

Rachel: So what are you gonna do?

Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father.

[Joey starts to eat the rest of the lasagna and makes noises. Everyone turns to stare at him.]

Joey: This is still ruined, right?

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's. Monica and Ross are pouring wine for their parents.]

Judy Geller: Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. [tastes a snack] Mmm! What's that curry taste?

Monica: Curry.

Judy Geller: Mmmm!

Ross: I-I think they're great. I, I really do.

Jack Geller: [to Ross] You remember the Ludwins? The big one had a thing for you, didn't she?

Judy Geller: They all had a thing for him.

Ross: Oh, Mom.

Monica: I'm sorry. Why is this girl going to call me?

Judy Geller: Oh, she just graduated. And she wants to be something in cooking or food, or…I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant-

Monica: No, Mom. I don't have a restaurant. I work in a restaurant.

Judy Geller: Well, they don't have to know that. [She starts to fluff the same pillow that Monica fluffed multiple times earlier.]

Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?

Ross: Yes.

Judy Geller: Oh, we're having spaghetti. That's…easy.

Monica: Actually, we were going to have lasagna.

Jack Geller: Oh, I love lasagna.

Monica: Well, we're not having it.

Judy Geller: Then why did you bring it up? You know how he *latches on*.

Monica: I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish on my part, but were you planning on bringing up the whole baby-lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.

[Time Lapse. Everyone is now eating.]

Judy Geller: What that Rachel did to her life. We ran into her parents at the club. They were not playing very well.

Jack Geller: I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding, but 40,000 dollars is a lot of money.

Judy Geller: Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the *altar*.

Monica: What's that supposed to mean?

Judy Geller: Nothing. It's an expression.

Monica: No, it's not.

Jack Geller: Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have been. Even when you were a kid, and you were *chubby*, and you had no friends, you were just fine. And you'd read alone in your room, and your puzzles.

[Time Lapse]

Jack Geller: Look, there are people like Ross who need to shoot for the stars, with his museum and his papers getting published. Other people are satisfied with staying where they are. I'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer. They're happy with what they have. They're basically content like …cows.

Ross: Cows, Dad?

Jack Geller: She knows how much I like cows.

[Time Lapse]

Jack Geller: And I read about these women trying to have it all. And I thank God, our little *harmonica* doesn't seem to have that problem. I'm telling you, sweetheart, you're gonna be fine.

Monica: Thank you, Daddy.

Judy Geller: [turns on a Dustbuster] Oh, so this does work.

Monica: [trying desperately to change the subject] So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? [digs her elbow into his hand] No news? No little *anecdotes* to share with the folks?

Ross: [pulls his hand away] Okay! Okay. [to the parents] Look, I, uh, I realize you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me. And so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child. And she and Susan are going to raise the baby.

[*Stunned* silence *ensues*.]

Judy Geller: [to Monica] And you knew about this?

[Monica and Ross are in disbelief.]

Commercial Break

[Scene: Central Perk. Everyone's there.]

Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh?

Ross: Well, you know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing. They take their time. They get the job done.

Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents. Boy, if you could, [to Ross] I'd want yours.

Ross: Must pee. [goes to the bathroom]

Phoebe: You know, it's even worse when you're twins.

Rachel: You're a twin?

Phoebe: Oh, yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven, career type.

Chandler: What does she do?

Phoebe: She's a waitress.

Joey: Identical?

Phoebe: Yeah. People say we look alike. But I don't see it.

Rachel: All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. [They all start to leave.]

Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this.

Chandler: Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who…my parents actually preferred.

Rachel: Hit the lights, please.

[Joey turns off the lights. They all leave. Rachel starts to clean up. Ross enters from the bathroom.]

Ross: How long was I in there?

Rachel: I'm just cleaning up.

Ross: Oh, you, uh...You need any help?

Rachel: Uh, okay. Sure. Thanks. [She hands him the broom and goes to sit down.]

Ross: Anyway, [starts to sweep] so, you, uh, you nervous about Barry tomorrow?

Rachel: Oh, a little.

Ross: Mmm hmm.

Rachel: A lot.

Ross: Mmm.

Rachel: So, got any advice? You know, as someone who's recently been dumped?

Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Uh, chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, you know. So you should try not to look too terrific. I know it'll be hard. Or, you know, I can, uh…Hey, I'll go down there. And I'll give Barry back his ring. And you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB-GYN.

Rachel: You've got Carol tomorrow. Oh, when did it get so complicated?

Ross: Got me.

Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together?

Ross: Yeah.

Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love, and that'd be it? [Ross gazes at her.] ...Ross?

Ross: Yes. Yes.

Rachel: Oh, man. I never thought I'd be here. [She leans back onto his hand.]

Ross: Me neither. [He pulls up a *stool* so that he doesn't have to move his hand.]

[Scene: Carol's OB-GYN. Carol is waiting. ]

Ross: [enters] Hi. Oh, sorry, I'm late. I got stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur...thing anyway.

[Susan enters holding a drink.]

Susan: Hi.

Carol: Ross, you remember Susan?

Ross: How could I forget?

Susan: Ross. [shakes hands with him]

Ross: Hello, Susan. Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for…?

Carol: Dr. Oberman.

Ross: Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he-

Susan: She.

Ross: She, of course. She, uh, familiar with our special situation?

Carol: Yes. And she's very supportive.

Ross: Great. Okay. That's great. [Susan gives her drink to Carol.] No, I'm-Oh.

Carol: Thanks.

Ross: [picks up a surgical instrument and mimes a duck with it] Quack-quack, quack-quack, quack-quack-quack…

Carol: Ross, that opens my *cervix*. [He drops it in horror.]

[Scene: Barry's Office. Barry is working on a patient, Robbie. Rachel enters.]

Rachel: Barry?

Barry: Come on in.

Rachel: [hesitates] Are you sure?

Barry: Yeah. It's fine. It's fine. Robbie's gonna be here for hours.

Robbie: Huh!

Barry: So, how're you doing?

Rachel: I'm, uh, I'm okay. You look great.

Barry: Yeah, well.

Bernice: [over the intercom] Dr. Farber, Jason Greenspan's *gagging*.

Barry: Be right there. [to Robbie and Rachel] Be back in a second.

[Barry exits. Robbie stares at Rachel.]

Rachel: I dumped him.

Robbie: Okay.

[Scene: Carol's OB-GYN. Ross sees a model of a baby in a womb. He touches it. The baby falls out. He catches the baby and places it back in the womb.]

Carol: Oh! Ross.

Ross: So, um, so how's this, uh, how's this all gonna work?

Susan: Well, the baby grows in a special place inside the mommy's-

Ross: Thank you. I mean, how is this gonna work, you know, with us? You know, when, when important decisions have to be made?

Carol: Give me a 'for instance'.

Ross: Well, I don't know. Okay. Okay. How about with the, uh, the baby's name?

Carol: Marlon.

Ross: Marlon?

Carol: If it's a boy. Minnie, if it's a girl.

Ross: As in 'Mouse'?

Carol: As in my grandmother.

Ross: Still, you, you say Minnie, you hear 'Mouse'. Um, how about...How about Julia?

Carol: Julia.

Susan: We agreed on Minnie.

Ross: It's funny. Um, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change. Roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table?

[Scene: Barry's Office. Rachel is doing her makeup in a mirror. Barry enters.]

Barry: Oh, sorry about that. So, what have you been up to?

Rachel: Oh, not much. I-I got a job.

Barry: Oh, that's great.

Rachel: Why are, why are you so *tanned*?

Barry: Oh, I, uh, I went to Aruba.

Rachel: Oh, no. You went on our honeymoon alone?

Barry: No. I went with, uh...Now, this may hurt.

Robbie: Me?!

Barry: No! [to Rachel] I went with Mindy.

Rachel: Mindy? My maid of honor, Mindy?!

Barry: Yeah. We're, uh, kind of a thing now.

Rachel: Oh! Well, I'm...[grabs his forehead] You got *plugs*!

Barry: Okay. Careful. Careful. They haven't quite taken yet.

Rachel: And you got lenses. But you hate sticking your finger in your eye.

Barry: Not for her. Listen, I, I really wanted to thank you.

Rachel: Okay.

Barry: See, about a month ago, I wanted to hurt you, more than I've ever wanted to hurt anyone in my life. And I'm an orthodontist.

Rachel: Wow.

Barry: You know, you were right. I thought we were happy. We weren't happy. But with Mindy, now I'm happy. Spit.

Rachel: What?

Robbie: Me. [spits]

Rachel: Anyway, um, [gets the ring out of her purse] I guess, I guess this belongs to you. Or, hey, maybe someday Mindy.

Barry: Yeah. Like she'd settle for that.

Rachel: [sarcastically laughs] Oh yeah. Yeah, that's true. Um, but I think, I think it's a nice ring. And thank you for giving it to me.

Barry: Well, thank you for giving it back.

[Barry and Rachel look at each other holding hands.]

Robbie: Hello?!

[Scene: Carol's OB/GYN. They're still arguing about the baby's name.]

Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen?

Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so.

Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller.

Ross: Thank you!

Carol: No. I mean, it's not Geller.

Ross: Wh-what, it's gonna be Helen Willick?

Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick Bunch.

Ross: Wait a minute. Wha- Why is she in the title?

Susan: Because it's my baby too.

Ross: Oh, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm.

Susan: Yeah. And we all know what a challenge that is!

Carol: All right, you two, stop it!

Ross: No-no-no, she gets a credit. Hey, I'm in there too.

Carol: Ross, you're not actually suggesting Helen Willick Bunch Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse.

Ross: Of course not. I'm…suggesting Geller Willick Bunch.

Susan: Oh, no, no-no-no-no-no. You see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names. He knows they'll wind up calling her Geller. Then he gets his way!

Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way. You know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not- I can't do-

Dr. Oberman: [enters] Knock, knock! How are we today? Any *nausea*?

All: A little. Yeah. Just a little.

Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but thanks for sharing. [to Carol] Uh, lie back.

Ross: You, uh, you know what? I'm gonna go. I don't, I don't think I can be involved in this particular family.

[He turns to go. But the sound of the sonogram catches his ear. He returns and stares at it.]

Ross: Oh my God! [holds Carol's and Susan's hand]

Susan: Look at that.

Carol: I know.

Closing Credits

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's. Everyone is watching the tape of the sonogram. Rachel is on the phone.]

Ross: Well, isn't that amazing?

Joey: What are we supposed to be seeing here?

Chandler: I don't know. But I think it's about to attack The Enterprise.

Phoebe: You know, if you *tilt* your head to the left and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato.

Ross: Then don't do that, alright?

Phoebe: Okay.

Ross: [walks over to Monica] Monica. What do you think?

Monica: Mmm hmm.

Ross: Wha- Are you welling up?

Monica: No.

Ross: You are. You are. You're welling up.

Monica: I'm not!

Ross: You're gonna be an aunt.

Monica: [pushes him and starts to cry] Oh, shut up!

Rachel: [on the phone] Hi, Mindy. Hi, it's, it's Rachel. Yeah, I'm fine. I-I saw Barry today. Oh, yeah. Yeah. He-he told me. No. No, it's okay, really. It's okay. I hope you two are very happy. I really do. Oh, and  Mind, you know, if-if everything works out, and you guys end up getting married and having kids and everything, I just hope they have his old hairline and your old nose. [slams the phone down, to everyone] Okay, I know it was a cheap shot. But I feel so much better now.
